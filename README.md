# DceMrReader
Python code for reading in DICOM DCE-MRI series and selecting AIF voxels.

We would be grateful if you would reference the following abstract if you use this code:
Anita Banerji, Derek Magee, Constantina Chrysochou, Philip Kalra, David Buckley, and Steven Sourbron. "Assessment of an automated method for AIF voxel selection for renal filtration rate estimation from DCE-MRI data." Proceedings of the ISMRM (Singapore), 2016.

NOT FOR CLINICAL USE. FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

This code has been developed to:

Read DCE-MR time series from DICOM, extended DICOM and NEMA files.
There are some analysis functions (such as generating a maximum change from average baseline map).
There is also some functionality to select AIF voxels.

This is not a fully tested and complete application. 
But I thought some of the functionality might be of use to the MR research community so have made it available.
